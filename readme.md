Doing the [reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) challenges is fun. Having to put four spaces in front of each of your lines of code so that your code will not be shown unless hovered over is not, unless you happen to frequent [reddit.com/r/codegolf](https://www.reddit.com/r/codegolf) as well.
